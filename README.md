# FPGA-ECU
This project is definitely tops my most nerve-racking projects of all time. In this work, our team aimed to build an EMU (Engine Monitoring Unit) capable of running independantly of ECU (Engine Control Unit) to monitor Engine Conditions such as colour, temperature and condition. We used PMOD colour module, Hygromodule and GPS module. The GPS module sends the GPS location to the mainframe for emergency contact, in case of an engine failure.
